## Scoring
1. Project Requirements: You may earn a score of 0 or 1. You will earn a score of 1 if all project requirements are met. Otherwise, you will earn a score of 0.
2. Audience: You may earn a score between 0 and 3. A score of 0 indicates that your presentation is inappropriate for the stakeholder. A score of 1 indicates that at least part of your presentation should be non-trivially reworked to be more appropriate for the stakeholder. A score of 2 indicates that there are few to no areas of your presentation that should be reworked. A score of 3 indicates that your presentation is consistently appropriate for the stakeholder and serves as a model for future presentations.
3. Methods: You may earn a score between 0 and 3. A score of 0 indicates that your methods are inappropriate. A score of 1 indicates that your methods are somewhat inappropriate, that justification for methodological decisions is lacking, and/or that your conclusions do not follow from the methods. A score of 2 indicates that your methods are appropriate, justification is sufficient/strong, and your conclusions follow well from the methods. A score of 3 indicates that your methods are excellent, strongly defended, and serves model for future presentations.
4. Value: You may earn a score between 0 and 3. A score of 0 indicates that you provide little to no value to the stakeholder. A score of 1 indicates that the value you provide to the stakeholder is substantially less than expected by not answering the problem, not providing clear recommendations to the stakeholder, and/or providing recommendations that were not data-driven. A score of 2 indicates that the value you provide to the stakeholder is on par with the expectation of providing clear, data-driven recommendations that directly answer the problem posed. A score of 3 indicates that the value you provide to the stakeholder is beyond what is expected and serves as a model for future presentations.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:
- If any project requirement is not met, the final grade is 'Fail' with a score of 0.
- If all project requirements are met, then the final grade is 'Pass' with a score calculated by summing the above scores. Therefore, if all project requirements are met, the final score will be between a 1 and 10.

## Feedback

| Section | Score | Notes |
|:--------|:------|:------|
| **Requirements** | **1.0** |  
| README contains the problem statement | 1.0 |   |
| README contains a succinct formulation of the question your analysis seeks to answer | 1.0  |   |
| README contains a table of contents, which should indicate which notebook or scripts a stakeholder should start with, and a link to an executive summary | 1.0 |   |
| README contains a paragraph description of the data you used, plus your data acquisition, ingestion, and cleaning steps  | 1.0 |    |
| README contains a short description of software requirements (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn) required by your analysis  | 0.0     | Not present.  |
| Notebooks are reproducable and error-free | 1.0 |   |
| Without us telling you exactly what model to build, how could you build a model to increase performance or generate better insights when answering the problem you are facing?   Bear in mind that the value you provide may come from data ingestion, data cleaning, EDA, and/ or a dashboard, etc. While a model may not be immediately apparent, be creative.    | 1.0     |   |
|**Audience** | **3.0** | 
| Did you frame the problem appropriately for the audience?   | 3.0 | Yes |
| Did you use the appropriate level of technical language for your audience? | 3.0  | Nothing too technical for a non-technical audience. |
| Did you effectively use your time, or did you encounter an issue such as going significantly beyond or under the allotted time or rushing to conclude the presentation in the allotted time? | 3.0     | Nothing felt rushed.  Analysis was nicely broken down and explained.  |
| Did you present effectively, or were there things that detract from the overall presentation such as not speaking loudly enough for the audience or repeating oneself?  | 3.0 | Nice flow and transitions from presenter to presenter.  Everyone was well spoken! |
| **Methods** | **2.0** | 
| Did you make well-reasoned modeling choices, or is there clear evidence that the model is inadequate or improper?  | 2.0  | Overall nice work.  I'm not sure about ordinal encoding for some of these features. |
| Are you able to clearly defend your methodological decisions and results? | 2.0  | I think the analysis is nicely done.  I think the benefit of a model in this case is for the inference.  Since logistic regression is so much easier to explain, and it scored similarly to random forrest, I think that would be the "production model."  It isn't clear to me what the use case is for the model otherwise. |
| Did you generalize your results properly, or were your conclusions/inferences improper or fallacious? | 3.0     | Good job interpretting the coefficients in a relative manner. |
| **Value** | **2.5** |
| Did you answer the problem posed to you?  | 3.0 |    |
| Did you make your recommendations clear, or were the recommendations unclear?  | 3.0  |   |
| Were your recommendations data-driven and based on the results of your work?  | 2.0  | Do you have any data to recommend those documentaries specifically?  Also be cautious about correlation vs. causation (is more discussion in homes leading to greater belief in climate change, or could it just be that people that already believe are more likely to talk about it). |
